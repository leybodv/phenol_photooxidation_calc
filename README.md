# phenol_photooxidation_calc
Command line program to process experimental data of phenol photooxidation experiment using multicomponent approach described in \[doi: 10.1016/S1386-1425(02)00172-5\] and \[doi: 10.1080/09593331708616383\]. To run program start `phphoxcalc_shell.py`. The program executes commands entered by user. Also there is an option to process commands from file line-by-ldine ignoring lines which start with '#' symbol.\
\
List of available commands (can be listed inside program by typing 'help' or '?'):\
\
`addexperiment id=<id> path=<path>`\
> adds experiment results which are uv-vis spectra obtained from samples collected at different time from the beginning of experiment\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<id>`: id of experiment, usually photocatalyst sample's id\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<path>`: path to file with experimental data in a format \<wavelength\>\<tab\>\<absorbance@time0\>\<tab\>\<absorbance@time1\>... with single header row in a format \<some-text\>\<tab\>\<time0\>\<tab\>\<time1\>...\
\
addcalibration solute=\<solute\> solvent=\<solvent\> path=\<path\>

        adds uv-vis spectra for absorbance vs. concentration calibration

        \<solute\>: compound's name which was used for calibration

        \<solvent\>: solvent used for calibration

        \<path\>: path to folder with calibration data in a format \<wavelength\>\<tab\>\<absorbance\> with single header row


processexperiments verbose=\<verbosity\>

        finds concentrations of phenol oxidation products vs. time based on experimental and calibration data

        \<verbosity\>: True|False, if True, plots of fitting experimental spectra by reference spectra will be shown

plotrawdata
        plots experimental uv-vis spectra added by addexperiment command

execute path=\<path\>
        executes commands in file line-by-line ignoring lines started with '#'
        \<path\>: path to file with commands

quit
        quits program
